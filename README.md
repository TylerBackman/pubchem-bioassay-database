PubChem Bioassay Database
======================

Downloads data from PubChem Bioassay, and loads it into a SQLite database

Use: clone repository and type "make working/pubchemBioassay.sqlite" 

Results file: working/pubchemBioassay.sqlite

This code is designed to work on the UC Riverside Biocluster system,
and may need modification to execute elsewhere. I don't recommend trying
to build this database yourself, but instead download the latest version
from  http://chemmine.ucr.edu/bioassayr
